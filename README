This is the read me for shell_statics(2).cpp

shell_statics(2).cpp reads in three files:
1. Vbar.obj: The rest configuration of the thin shell
2. V.obj : The initial guess of the deformed shell
3. fix_index.txt: this file should contained the total number and the index of fixed vertices and those vertices won't be updated, just put down zero if there is no fixed vertices

shell_static.cpp deals with fixed boundary conditions.
shell_static2.cpp deals with unbalanced surface area problem, where shrinkage refers to the shrinkage of top surface with the mid surface. 

The purpose of this code is to simulate the rest configuration of the thin under certain specified conditions.


# Below is the read me for burning_static.cpp
Input file : all files contain in Input_Filename.txt

Input_GlobalMD.dmat            : Define the Global MD inside the shell 
Input_MoistureLevel.dmat       : Define the moisture level on each face, could be calculated using Moist_calc.cpp
Input_calcIbar.txt             : The first line is the thickness, 2nd is the shrinking coefficient of MD, 3rd is the shrinking coefficient of CD
Ibar.damt                      : This should be calculted by Ibar_calc.cpp, please make sure that Vbar.obj is the rest configuration we're solving for
Input_burning_static.txt       : The first line is the Young's Modules, 2nd is Poisson Ratio, 3rd is Thickness and should be consistent with the value in Input_calcIbar.txt
                                 4th line is # of fixed particles, below : Index(?) of the fixed particles
RecUni.obj                     : Output configuration
